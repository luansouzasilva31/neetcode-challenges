# neetcode-challenges
Challenges listed in NeetCode channel on YouTube. Sorted in EASY, MEDIUM and HARD challenge levels.

The strategy is simple:
  1. Plan the problem solution using the best strategy I can think that time;
  2. Implement the solution based on the planned strategy;
  3. Watch NeetCode *theoretical* solution;
  4. If I succeed in (2):
     1. Compare the core idea behind both solutions (e.g. the data structure used);
     2. Compare the complexity of both solutions;
  5. If I do not succeed in (2) **or** or my solution is more complex than NeetCode one (as listed in 4.2) :  
     1. Implement a solution based on NeetCode *theoretical* solution
  6. If I still can't solve this (:cry:):
     1. I check the NeetCode *scripting* solution.
