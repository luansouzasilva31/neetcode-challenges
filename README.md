# neetcode-challenges
Challenges listed in NeetCode channel on YouTube. Sorted in EASY, MEDIUM and HARD challenge levels.

The strategy is simple:
  1. Try to implement;
  2. If I'm failing (:cry:), first of all I'll google it to get some insights;
  3. If I'm still failing (:sob:), then I look into NeetCode's solution, understand it and then try to implement by myself.
   
After I complete my solution, I compare it to the NeetCode's and check the complexity. If mine is not optimized, I try to do so.
